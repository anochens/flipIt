<h2>Basic Rules</h2>
<ul style='list-style-type: none'><li>
<p>You will be playing multiple rounds of a two-player game called FlipIt. The objective of FlipIt is to gain and maintain possession of a game board. Until you take an action, the state of the game board is hidden from your view, and no information is provided to you.</p>
 
<p>The only action you have available is to "flip" the board. When you flip the board, you gain possession of the board, or maintain possession if you already owned the board. The same rules apply to your opponent.</p>

<p>When you flip the board, you will be provided with information in graphical form about the game play, which we detail below.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Available Information during the Game</h2>
<ul style='list-style-type: none'><li>

<p>If your opponent flipped the board since you last took action, then you will regain control over the board with your flip. You will see a graphic on the screen that shows how long you had possession of the board since your last flip. This is indicated by a blue bar of variable length. You will also see how long the opponent had possession of the board. This is shown with a red bar of variable length.<p>

<p>You will also be provided with an additional piece of information. It may happen that the opponent tried to flip the board multiple times up until your most recent flip. The small red "x" symbols indicate the number of flips that your opponent did after he already had possession of the board.</p>

<p>If you flip at a time when you already own the board, then you will see a large blue "X" on the screen. You will continue to maintain possession of the board.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Examples of the Graphical Information</h2>
<ul style='list-style-type: none'><li>
 
<p>Please take a look at the following examples from a specific game.</p>

<center><img src='images/midgame3.png' />   </center>

<p>You can see that you had possession of the board after your last flip as indicated by the blue bar. You lost possession when the opponent flipped the board, and the opponent began to accumulate possession time. The opponent flipped two more times but the flips only maintained the opponent's possession of the board. Those two flips are indicated by the two red "x" below the red bar. The location of the two red "x" below the red bar does not signal when exactly these additional flips happened.
</p>

<p>Consider the next chart:</p>
<center><img src='images/midgame4.png' /></center>

<p>This sequence differs from the example above in several ways. You owned the board for a longer period of time before the opponent played flip. The opponent owned the board for a shorter amount of time, and played only one additional flip that did not change the status of the board.
</p>

<p>The next situation shows what happens when you flip while already owning the board. You are shown a large blue "X". Please note that each flip is costly. 
</p>

<p>Please remember that you cannot observe if and when the opponent flipped the board
in the past, until you take the action to flip the board yourself.</p>

<p>Below, we provide additional important details of the game and show an example for a complete FlipIt game.</p>

	 <p>   
	  Let's examine the moves made in this example game:
	  </p>
	  <ul>
		 <li>
			<i>1st second</i>: The blue player starts in control.
		 </li>
		 <li>
			<i>2nd second:</i> The red player plays 'flip' and gains control. The red player plays 'flip' again less than a second later and remains in control.
		 </li>
		 <li> 
			<i>3rd second:</i> The blue player plays 'flip' and regains control. He maintains control for a bit over 2 seconds.
		 </li>
		 <li>
			<i>5th second:</i> The red player plays 'flip' and regains control. He keeps control for less than a second.
		 </li>
		 <li>
			<i>6th second:</i> The blue player plays 'flip' and regains control. He keeps control for about 2 seconds.
		 </li>                                                         
		 <li>
			<i>7th second:</i> The red player plays 'flip' and regains control. He keeps control for about 1 second.
		 </li>                                                         
		 <li>
			<i>9th second:</i> The blue player plays 'flip' and regains control. He maintains control for 4 seconds.
		 </li>                                                          
		 <li>
			<i>12th second:</i> The red player plays 'flip' and regains control. He maintains control for the rest of the game. He makes a number of flips in which he maintains control.
		 </li>                                                          
		 <li>
			<i>20th second:</i> The game ends.
		 </li>
	  </ul>
	
	  </p>

	  <p> 
	  The blue player was in control for <b>8.05</b> seconds earning <b>805</b> points, and played 'flip' 3 times, costing <b>300</b> points. This gives him a total score of <b>505</b> points.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The red player was in control for <b>11.95</b> seconds earning <b>1195</b> points, and played 'flip' 9 times, costing <b>900</b> points. This gives him a total score of <b>295</b> points.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  The blue player has more points than the red player and thus wins.

	  <h3>Payment</h3> 
	  <p>
You will be compensated according to your performance in this study. For completing the study, you are guaranteed the amount listed on the Mechanical Turk HIT that you have accepted, and you will be paid an additional sum based on your performance.<br> 
You will participate in multiple rounds of the game. At first, you will participate in a practice round without a bonus payment to familiarize yourself with the interface. Then, you will participate in several additional rounds. You can receive a bonus payment for your performance in each of those rounds.<br>
You can increase your bonus payment in a given round by performing well compared to the red player. If you lose by more than 1000 points, however, you will receive no bonus payment for that round.<br> 
The exchange rate for points into the bonus payment is 1 cent for 100 points. For example, you would earn a bonus payment of 10 cents by gaining exactly as many points as the red player. If you outperform your opponent by 500 points you would earn 15 cents. If you underperform you opponent by 500 points you would earn 5 cents.<br>
